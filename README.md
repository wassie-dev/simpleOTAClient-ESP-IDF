# SimpleOTAClient-ESP-IDF

First-party ESP-IDF component for the [SimpleOTA](https://simpleota.com)
firmware update platform, published to the Espressif Component Registry as
[`xanderwasserman/simpleota`](https://components.espressif.com/components/xanderwasserman/simpleota).

[Managed fleet OTA for ESP32 devices in the field](https://simpleota.com/?utm_source=idf_registry&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=signup_v1)

```sh
idf.py add-dependency "xanderwasserman/simpleota"
```

Full documentation (features, configuration, signed firmware, rollback):
**[simpleota/README.md](simpleota/README.md)** (the component itself, also
rendered on the registry page). On a trial boot the component arms the
chip's RTC or LP watchdog for the confirm timeout plus a margin, so a hang
that stops the confirm timer still resets the chip and the bootloader
switches back.

Complete example projects: [examples/basic](examples/basic) and
[examples/signed](examples/signed). The examples build against the in-repo
component via a local override, so they always exercise the checked-out code.

New to ESP-IDF, or want to test on real hardware? See
[docs/hardware-testing.md](docs/hardware-testing.md) for a full
install-to-first-OTA walkthrough.

Host-side tests for the security-critical modules: `make -C test/host test`.

**Releasing** (mirrors SimpleOTAClient-Arduino): bump `version:` in
[simpleota/idf_component.yml](simpleota/idf_component.yml) and merge to
`main`. Once CI is green, the Release workflow tags `vX.Y.Z`, creates the
GitHub release, and uploads to the Espressif Component Registry
automatically. Pushes that do not bump the version release nothing.
Registry versions are immutable, so a version publishes exactly once.
