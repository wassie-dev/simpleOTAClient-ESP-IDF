# SimpleOTA client for ESP-IDF

First-party ESP-IDF component for the [SimpleOTA](https://simpleota.com)
firmware update platform. Polls for updates, streams and flashes offered
firmware with on-the-fly SHA-256 and Ed25519 signature verification, reports
the full update lifecycle to the dashboard, and integrates with the ESP-IDF
bootloader's app-rollback support so a bad build backs itself out.

The sibling of [SimpleOTAClient-Arduino](https://github.com/xanderwasserman/SimpleOTAClient-Arduino):
both clients implement the same device API contract and the same signed
firmware semantics, so mixed fleets behave identically. A device keeps its
identity (Wi-Fi MAC device id) across a migration between the two.

Local OTA (ArduinoOTA, espota, ElegantOTA) is for a board on your desk. SimpleOTA is managed fleet OTA for ESP32 when those devices are in the field, without pulling you into a full IoT platform.

You upload a .bin from PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, Arduino, or CI, and devices check in on their own. Eligible ones get a short-lived pre-signed URL and pull firmware straight from object storage. Rollouts can start at 5% with deterministic bucketing, so the same unit stays in the same cohort. Builds can be Ed25519-signed and verified on the device during download, before the new partition is marked bootable. After reboot there's a trial window: crash or no successful check-in, and the device rolls back.

Signing here protects the delivery path. It is not Secure Boot. They stack if you already use Secure Boot.

## Install

```sh
idf.py add-dependency "xanderwasserman/simpleota"
```

## Requirements

- ESP-IDF **v5.1 or newer** (tested through IDF 6.x). Targets: esp32, esp32s2,
  esp32s3, esp32c3, esp32c6, esp32h2.
- A partition table with **two OTA app slots**, and (strongly recommended)
  bootloader rollback. In your project's `sdkconfig.defaults`:

  ```
  CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_TWO_OTA=y
  CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE=y
  CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_4MB=y
  ```

  Both settings live in the bootloader / partition table and must ship with
  the **first serial flash**; they cannot be enabled later over OTA. Without
  `BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` the component still updates firmware, but
  without automatic rollback (images are confirmed on the first successful
  check-in instead).

## Quick start

```c
#include "simpleota.h"

void app_main(void) {
    // nvs_flash_init() + your Wi-Fi bring-up first...

    simpleota_config_t cfg = {
        .token = "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN",   // Project -> API tokens (device scope)
    };
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(simpleota_init(&cfg));
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(simpleota_start());
}
```

That is a complete integration: the component starts a background task that
checks hourly, flashes offered builds, reboots into them as a supervised
trial, and confirms them once the new image completes a successful check-in.
See [examples/basic](../examples/basic) for a full project including Wi-Fi
bring-up, and [examples/signed](../examples/signed) for signed firmware.

## Configuration

All fields of `simpleota_config_t` (strings are copied at init):

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | required | Project API token (device scope) or per-device token |
| `base_url` | `https://simpleota.com` | Platform base URL |
| `device_id` | Wi-Fi STA MAC (`aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`) | Stable per-unit identifier |
| `chip_family` | `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET` | e.g. `esp32`, `esp32s3`, `esp32c3` |
| `board_id`, `hardware_revision`, `partition_profile`, `channel` | omitted | Compatibility metadata; report what your artifacts constrain |
| `labels_json` | omitted | Reserved: sent verbatim on check-ins, not yet consumed by the platform |
| `security_mode` | omitted | `SIMPLEOTA_SECURITY_SIGNED` to enforce signed firmware |
| `version_label` | last persisted | Display-only version string |
| `nvs_schema_version` | 1 | On-device data schema the firmware expects |
| `check_interval_s` | 3600 | Steady-state poll interval |
| `initial_delay_ms` | 0 | Delay before the first check after `simpleota_start()` |
| `confirm_timeout_s` | 300 | Trial window before automatic rollback |
| `manual_confirm` | false | true: you call `simpleota_confirm()` after health checks |
| `disable_auto_reboot` | false | true: you call `simpleota_reboot_for_update()`. No further update is downloaded until then. |
| `signing_keys`, `num_signing_keys` | none | Up to 2 pinned Ed25519 public keys (PEM) |
| `is_connected` | always try | Return false while the link is down. It is polled every second, and the check runs as soon as it returns true |
| `event_cb`, `user_ctx` | none | Lifecycle events (see `simpleota_event_id_t`) |
| `cert_pem` | none | Pin a specific CA instead of the certificate bundle |
| `crt_bundle_attach` | `esp_crt_bundle_attach` | Override the bundle function |

Build-time knobs (menuconfig, "SimpleOTA"): task stack size (12288),
priority (5), HTTP timeout (15 s), HTTP TX buffer (2048 -- must fit the long
pre-signed download URLs), download chunk size (4096).

## Update lifecycle

Status events reported to the dashboard, in order:

```
download_started -> downloaded -> flashed -> validated -> reboot
    -> (next successful check-in) confirmed | rolled_back
```

Failures report `failed` with a reason token (`checksum_mismatch`,
`signature_invalid`, `download_stalled`, `update_begin_failed`, ...) that the
dashboard shows inline on the device row. Once a boot has worked out what
happened to a trial, its `confirmed` or `rolled_back` report goes to an outbox
in NVS (two slots, oldest dropped first) and never holds up an update. Reports
are kept until the server answers, across reboots: any HTTP response counts as
delivered, and the device does not act on what it says. Without a response the
report is sent again, first after 10 s (three times), then at the normal check
interval.

## Rollback

With `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE`, a freshly flashed image boots
as PENDING_VERIFY: the **bootloader itself** guarantees one attempt. If the
image crashes or loses power before confirmation, the next boot returns to
the previous app. On top of that, the component runs a confirm timeout
(default 300 s): if the new image runs but never completes a successful
check-in, it is marked invalid and the device reboots into the previous
build, reporting `rolled_back` / `confirm_timeout`.

After any rollback the component restores the previous build number in NVS,
so the dashboard sees the truth and the server can re-offer fixed builds. The
`rolled_back` report carries the detected cause: `confirm_timeout` when the
component's own supervision marked the image invalid. Otherwise the reset that
ended the trial: `panic`, `int_wdt`, `task_wdt`, `watchdog`, `brownout`,
`power_on`, `deep_sleep`, or `reset` (also used when the bootloader refused the
image, for example on an image-verification or Secure Boot rejection). Even
without `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE`, a corrupt image can be refused
by the bootloader's basic image verification and then surfaces as
`rolled_back`.

`simpleota_confirm()` marks the image valid in the bootloader first. If that
fails, it returns the error and the trial keeps running, so call it again.
While a trial is running, no further update is downloaded: the other slot holds
the previous image the trial may still return to.

Confirmation is automatic on the first successful check-in. If your
application has its own health checks, set `.manual_confirm = true` and call
`simpleota_confirm()` once they pass.

## Signed firmware

Uploads with `security_mode: "signed"` carry an Ed25519 signature over the
exact binary bytes. Pin your project's public key and the device verifies
every image during download, **before** the partition is marked bootable:

```c
static const char *PUBKEY_PEM =
    "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
    "...from the dashboard's Signing keys section...\n"
    "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n";

const simpleota_signing_key_t keys[] = {{.key_id = "prod-2026", .pem = PUBKEY_PEM}};
simpleota_config_t cfg = {
    .token = "...",
    .security_mode = SIMPLEOTA_SECURITY_SIGNED,
    .signing_keys = keys,
    .num_signing_keys = 1,
};
```

Behavior matrix (identical to the Arduino client):

| Device state | Offer | Result |
|---|---|---|
| signed mode + key pinned | valid signature | verify during download; flash only on pass |
| signed mode + key pinned | missing/invalid/stripped signature | **rejected before flashing**; `failed` / `signature_invalid`; device stays on current build |
| key pinned (any mode) | signed offer without usable signature | rejected (fail closed) |
| no key pinned | signed offer | applied with a prominent "unverified" warning (keeps basic -> signed migration flowing) |
| any | unsigned offer, device not enforcing | normal checksum-verified update |

An enforcing device (signed mode + pinned key) cannot be silently downgraded:
stripping the signature fields from a response fails closed.

**Key rotation:** pin the old and new key together (`num_signing_keys = 2`),
start signing with the new key in CI, revoke the old key on the server once
the fleet has moved.

**Migration (basic -> signed) for a deployed fleet:** ship one last `basic`
upload whose firmware pins the key and sets
`.security_mode = SIMPLEOTA_SECURITY_SIGNED`; devices then report signed mode
and all subsequent uploads are signed and verified. The server never offers a
signed artifact to a device still reporting basic.

**Scope note:** this verifies the *delivery path* (compromised build server,
leaked CI token, tampered storage, MITM). It is not Secure Boot: someone with
physical access can still reflash over serial. The two compose; if you enable
Secure Boot v2, sign the final (Secure-Boot-signed) binary for SimpleOTA and
note that a Secure Boot rejection surfaces as `update_end_failed`, distinct
from `signature_invalid`.

## TLS

Server and download connections use the ESP-IDF certificate bundle by
default (`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE`, enabled by default), so there
is no CA to paste or rotate. Pin a specific CA with `.cert_pem` if you
prefer. Plain HTTP download URLs are refused (`insecure_url`).

### Task watchdog warnings during the handshake

Verifying a certificate chain is a synchronous, CPU-bound operation inside
mbedTLS. The OTA task cannot yield while it runs, so the priority-0 IDLE
task may be starved for longer than the default 5 second task-watchdog
window, and you see a warning like:

```
E (17533) task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered. ... IDLE ...
```

This is a warning, not a crash: the check completes normally. It shows up
most often on the classic ESP32 at the default 160 MHz, on the first
handshake after boot. Any TLS client on this hardware can hit it; it is not
specific to this component, and the component cannot yield from inside the
mbedTLS call. Pick whichever fix suits your project:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S=30` | Widen the window, keep the watchdog. What the examples do, and the recommended default. |
| `CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ_240=y` | Roughly halves handshake time on ESP32/ESP32-S3 (not available on targets capped at 160 MHz, such as ESP32-C3). |
| `.cert_pem = <your CA>` | Pinning one CA verifies less than searching the full bundle. |
| `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU1=n` | Stops watching that core's idle task. Blunt; prefer the timeout. |

## Examples

- [examples/basic](../examples/basic): managed updates with rollback.
- [examples/signed](../examples/signed): on-device Ed25519 verification.

Both are complete projects (`idf.py menuconfig` for Wi-Fi + token, then
`idf.py flash monitor`). They build against the in-repo component through a
local override that works from any clone directory name (the component lives
in the `simpleota/` subdirectory precisely so the override resolves).

New to ESP-IDF, or testing on real hardware for the first time? See
[docs/hardware-testing.md](../docs/hardware-testing.md) for a full
install-to-first-OTA walkthrough.

## Testing

`make -C test/host test` runs the security-critical modules (Ed25519
verification, SHA-256, the signed-firmware gate, response parsing) on the
host with plain cc: RFC 8032 vectors, NIST SHA-256 vectors, a vector
generated by the actual SimpleOTA server stack, tamper/wrong-key/truncation
negatives, key rotation, and the full gate truth table. CI builds both
examples across IDF v5.1 through latest on Xtensa and RISC-V targets.
