/**
 * @file
 * @brief The SimpleOTA client for ESP32, the same API in the ESP-IDF
 * component and the Arduino library.
 *
 * Thin client for the SimpleOTA firmware update platform
 * (https://simpleota.com). Polls the check endpoint, streams and flashes
 * offered firmware with on-the-fly SHA-256 and Ed25519 signature
 * verification, reports lifecycle events, and runs every new image as a
 * trial that rolls back unless it is confirmed.
 *
 * The application owns network bring-up (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) and decides when
 * the client may talk to the network via the optional is_connected
 * callback; the client does the rest from its own background task
 * (managed mode). In polling mode the application calls simpleota_check()
 * and simpleota_apply() from its own task instead, and confirms a trial with
 * simpleota_confirm().
 *
 * Quick start:
 * @code
 * simpleota_config_t cfg = {0};      // {} in an Arduino sketch
 * cfg.token = "sota_pk_...";        // project (or device) token
 * cfg.is_connected = wifi_up;       // or start after the IP arrives
 * ESP_ERROR_CHECK(simpleota_init(&cfg));
 * ESP_ERROR_CHECK(simpleota_start());
 * @endcode
 *
 * The device needs a partition table with two OTA app slots, which
 * Arduino-ESP32's default has. On ESP-IDF, rollback by the bootloader needs
 * CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE=y, which Arduino-ESP32 sets. Both
 * ship with the first serial flash and cannot change over OTA. Without
 * bootloader rollback the client rolls a failed trial back itself
 * (CONFIG_SIMPLEOTA_SOFTWARE_ROLLBACK): on the confirm timeout, or on any
 * reset before the confirm, as the bootloader would. It cannot catch an
 * image that crashes before simpleota_init() on every boot.
 *
 * The client is a process-wide singleton (one instance per device);
 * a second simpleota_init() returns ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE.
 *
 * Thread-safety: configure and init from one task. After init the public
 * functions are safe to call from any task, except that polling mode and
 * simpleota_set_server_url() belong to one task of the application's.
 *
 * Logs use the tag "simpleota". Warnings and errors show by default;
 * esp_log_level_set("simpleota", ESP_LOG_DEBUG) after simpleota_init()
 * shows every step.
 *
 * Compatibility, which every later 1.x release keeps:
 * - A configuration field left at zero (or NULL, or false) gets its default.
 *   New fields follow the same rule, so a config filled from `{0}` keeps
 *   building and keeps its behaviour.
 * - Functions, fields, result values and event ids are only added, never
 *   changed or removed; check SIMPLEOTA_API_VERSION before using a newer
 *   one.
 * - The `reason` tokens listed at simpleota_event_t are stable. New tokens
 *   may be added, so treat an unknown one as a generic failure.
