/**
 * sota_json.h - minimal flat-JSON value extraction for SimpleOTA responses.
 *
 * Finds a "key" among the top-level object's members and reads its string /
 * bool / unsigned value. Keys inside nested objects and arrays are not
 * matched, so a nested field cannot stand in for a top-level one. This is NOT a
 * general JSON parser; it is a C port of the hardware-proven scanner the
 * Arduino client has used since its first release. Chosen over cJSON
 * because the bundled `json` component left the ESP-IDF core in IDF 6, and
 * a vendored copy would risk duplicate symbols in apps that use cJSON
 * themselves.
 *
 * Portable (no platform headers): host-tested in test/host/.
