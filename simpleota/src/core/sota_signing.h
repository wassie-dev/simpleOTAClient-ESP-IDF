/**
 * sota_signing.h - Ed25519 firmware-signature helpers for the SimpleOTA
 * clients.
 *
 * Portable (no platform dependencies) so it can be unit-tested on a host
 * machine with plain cc/g++; see test/host/test_signing.c.
 *
 * The SimpleOTA server delivers, for artifacts uploaded with security_mode
 * "signed", a base64 Ed25519 signature computed over the raw firmware bytes
 * exactly as downloaded. The device pins the project's PUBLIC key (it is not
 * a secret) and must verify the signature over the downloaded bytes BEFORE
 * the new image is marked bootable.
 *
 * Verification is incremental (Monocypher's streaming Ed25519 check) so the
 * image never has to fit in RAM: the apply path feeds the same chunks it
 * writes to the OTA partition.
