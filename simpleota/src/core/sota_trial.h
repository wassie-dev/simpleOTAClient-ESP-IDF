/**
 * sota_trial.h - what a boot means for a saved trial record.
 *
 * The trial record uses NVS keys that every release of both clients reads
 * and writes: sota_trial (1 = trial, 3 = a trial whose image has booted,
 * 2 = a rollback happened),
 * sota_new_part (where the update went) and sota_prev_part (the partition
 * the update replaced). Arduino releases up to 0.6.0 write only
 * sota_prev_part; ESP-IDF releases write both. The classifier uses
 * sota_new_part when it is there and falls back to sota_prev_part, so a
 * record from any earlier release of either client reads the way that
 * release meant it.
 *
 * The apply path also writes sota_staged before the boot slot switches and
 * removes it straight after, so a record whose slot switch never happened
 * can be told apart from a rollback. A release that does not know
 * sota_staged ignores it, and a record written without it reads like any
 * other, so updates in either direction between releases read the same way.
 *
 * Any trial value other than 0 and 2 is a trial, so a release that does not
 * know 3 reads it as one.
 *
 * No platform types, so the host tests can include this header.
